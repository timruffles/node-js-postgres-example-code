# Example code for Postgres on Node

This is the example code for my book, ['Postgres on Node'](https://leanpub.com/postgres-on-node).

## Install

Run `./install` in your terminal (bash enabled terminal on Windows). 

This will ensure you've got the pre-requesities:

- Node, version 6 +
- Postgres, version 9.4 +
